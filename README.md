# reservoir_persistence
This is the collection of code for the submitted paper "HIV reservoir ecology shows HIV persists due to infected cell proliferation". The ecological code uses integration sites to develop a model for the distribution of clone sizes from patients with suppressive ART. The model_ode code develops solves a mechanistic mathematical model meant to simulate a latent reservoir and an anatomic sanctuary site permissive of ongoing replication.
